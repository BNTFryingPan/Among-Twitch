Players can join the game with !join, and the game will start when the streamer or a mod does !start. A certian number of imposters will be chosen, and all players will be given assigned a number of "clues". these clues are who is and is not imposter. However, the imposter can also make up clues to confuse the others. to make the game fair, these clues will be whispered to players. The clues are not actually given until the first meeting starts.
